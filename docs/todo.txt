==== WIP ====
Content rendering pipeline
  -The master gulp tries to run on each env
  -Each project has it's own gulp :(
  -Plugins register actions (which can be gulp under the covers), which are run on a master taskrunner :)

Less renders automatically
The post-back flow + OAuth

=== NEXT STEPS ===
-Asset rendering for themes
-Content file filled in
-API for getting values (how do I secure those?)
-Tend to all of the todos
-Create instructions
  - Overview
  - Adding your link
  - Adding your own theme
  - Adding your own plugin
- Table auto-creation appears to error on the first time
